This letter serves to support Mr. SUN Guangli’s academic leave from 1 August 2021 to 31 December
2021 to CUHK Hong Kong – Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Research Institute (Futian) 
[FITRI] in Shenzhen. 

Certain equipments are needed for my thesis equipment, which are hardwares that the vendor did not provide shipping option to Hong Kong, 
they are located in FITRI in Shenzhen. In order to write my thesis, I has to fine-tune the 
equipment and collect first-hand data of the experiments every day. However, due to the pandemic 
situation and quarantine restrictions, it is difficult for me to travel back and forth from Hong 
Kong to Shenzhen every day. 
Attached document is the approval letter from my supervisor Prof. Yun-hui  LIU and my further explanation of my research requirements.
